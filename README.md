BUG FOUND: "Loading 9" - Values entered by a user are retrieved as 9. Original values are not affected, only non-original, non-zero values.
 -- FIXED!

BUG FOUND: "Gray tiles" - All tiles when starting a new game or loading a new game are colored gray. Only "original" tiles should be gray. Note: this does not occur in the emulator, only on my phone.
