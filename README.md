ClassicSudoku
=============

A repository for my Android Sudoku app

TO INSTALL:
ClassicSudoku is currently "In Development" and thus not yet available to install directly on your Android device.

However, if you still wish to try it out, you can do so from the source code present in this repo. You will need an installation of Android Studio. Download a copy of this source code, fork this repo, or clone it in order to get a local copy of the app. Then import the folder into Android Studio as an Android Application.

At this point, you can either choose to play it on your Android emulator or you can put your Android device into developer mode and play it on your Device. In the first case, simply press the play button and select your emulator. In the second case, plug your Android device into your computer running Android Studio via a USB cable. Then, press the play button in Android Studio and select your device instead of any emulator. You will only have to do this for the initial installation; afterwards, you can simply open the app on your device as if it were any other app.

TO PLAY:
The goal of Sudoku is to fill each of the tiles in a row, column, and zone with the numbers 1 to 9. There cannot be any repeats within the same row, column, or zone. This simple premise alone describes the craze that is Sudoku. Once you have filled in all 81 tiles, you've won the game!

ClassicSudoku will not prevent you from putting in any duplicate values or inform you if you do, so be careful!

Another important feature in Sudoku is the ability to fill in notes. These notes are handly little tools that players can use to keep track of the values that a Tile COULD be. To turn on "note-mode" for a specific tile, select that Tile and press the "Notes" button. Then select whichever numbers you want to add or remove from the notes.

To disable "note-mode" for a specific tile, select that tile and press the "Notes" button again. If there is only one note in the box, that note will be selected as the tile's value. Otherwise, all the notes will be erased.

If you're stuck and need a hint, you can simply press the 'hint' button. This will fill in a random tile in with the correct answer and mark it as an unchangeable tile, so you know it has to be right. It will only fill in tiles with incorrect or missing values, so you don't have to worry about getting a "hint" that you already know.

And if you're so stuck that even a hint here or there won't help you, you can always hit the 'Solve' button. This will immediately solve the puzzle for you. Satisfying! Be aware, though, that games won this way will not be recorded in your High Scores.

If you need to take a break from ClassicSudoku, simply hit the 'Save' button and you can resume your game at any time by re-entering the app from the Load screen. Alternatively, you can simply hit the back or home button on your device. This will save your current game, which you can then re-enter via the "Resume Game" button on the home screen. Please note that you can only resume the most recent game, though, so if you start a new game without saving the old game, you will lose the old game!
