ClassicSudoku
=============

A repository for my Android Sudoku app

TO INSTALL:
Navigate to ClassicSudoku/bin/ and download ClassicSudoku.apk. This is the file to install on your Android device. Once it is downloaded, simply select the .apk file. A popup may open at this point - select "Package Installer" and this will install ClassicSudoku on your Android device.

TO PLAY:
The goal of Sudoku is to fill each of the tiles in a row, column, and zone with the numbers 1 to 9. There cannot be any repeats within the same row, column, or zone. This simple premise alone describes the craze that is Sudoku. Once you have filled in all 81 tiles, you've won the game!

ClassicSudoku (in its current incarnation) will prevent you from putting in any duplicate values. Therefore, if you find that no number can be input into a given tile, that means you must have made a mistake earlier on.

If you need a hint, you can simply select a tile and hit the 'hint' button. This will fill the tile in with the correct answer and mark it as an unchangeable tile, so you know it has to be right.

And if you're so stuck that even a hint here or there won't help you, you can always hit the 'Solve' button. This will immediately solve the puzzle for you. Satisfying!

If you need to take a break from ClassicSudoku, simply hit the 'Save' button and you can resume your game at any time. In its current incarnation, ClassicSudoku does not allow you to have multiple ongoing games. This is planned for a future update, though, so don't worry -- it's coming!

Another key feature that will be coming soon is the ability to creates notes. In case you don't know, notes are those little numbers you put in the corner that represent the possible values that the tile can hold. This can be immensely helpful in the more difficult games. Right now, ClassicSudoku does not support notes, but don't worry -- they're coming, too.
